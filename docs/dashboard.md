# Dashboard

PinchTab includes a built-in web dashboard for monitoring and managing instances, profiles, and agent activity.

The dashboard is part of the **full server**:
- `pinchtab` or `pinchtab server` starts the full server and serves the dashboard
- `pinchtab bridge` does not serve the dashboard; it only exposes the single-instance bridge API

Access the dashboard at **`http://localhost:9867`** (adjust port if needed).

Alternatively, use **`http://localhost:9867/dashboard`** (also works for backward compatibility).

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides four main screens:

1. **Instances** — View and manage running Chrome instances
2. **Profiles** — Browse and launch saved browser profiles
3. **Profile Details** — Configure and launch a specific profile
4. **Agents Feed** — Monitor agent activity and automation workflows

## Navigation

The dashboard header provides tabs to switch between screens:

```text
[Instances] | [Profiles] | [Profile Details] | [Agents]
```

You can also navigate by clicking:
- An instance → shows its details
- A profile → shows its profile details screen
- An agent event → shows relevant instance/profile

---

## Status Indicators

### Instance Status
- **Running** (green) — Active Chrome process
- **Idle** (yellow) — Running but no tabs
- **Stopped** (red) — Process not running

### Profile Status
- **Active** (green) — At least one instance using it
- **Dormant** (gray) — No active instances
- **Launching** (blue) — Instance starting

### Agent Status
- **Success** (green) — Action completed
- **Error** (red) — Action failed
- **Pending** (yellow) — In progress
- **Cancelled** (gray) — Aborted

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `R` | Refresh current screen |
| `Esc` | Go back / Close modal |
| `Ctrl+K` | Search |
| `Ctrl+1` | Instances tab |
| `Ctrl+2` | Profiles tab |
| `Ctrl+3` | Profile Details tab |
| `Ctrl+4` | Agents Feed tab |

---

## Dark Mode

The dashboard automatically uses your system's dark/light preference.

Toggle manually:
- Click the theme toggle in the top-right corner (sun/moon icon)
- Preference is saved in browser local storage

---

## Performance & Limits

- **Refresh rate**: Real-time updates (WebSocket-based)
- **History retention**: Last 1000 agent events (older events archived)
- **Scalability**: Optimized for 10+ instances, 100+ profiles

For high-throughput monitoring, consider using the REST API directly:

```bash
# Get all instances
curl http://localhost:9867/instances

# Get all profiles
curl http://localhost:9867/profiles

# Stream agent events
curl http://localhost:9867/events/stream
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading

- Check if PinchTab is running: `curl http://localhost:9867/health`
- Check the port: Default is `9867`, adjust if you started with `--port`
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (most browsers)

### No Instances Showing

- Make sure at least one instance is running: `pinchtab --port 9867`
- Refresh the page (`R` key)
- Check browser console for errors (`F12`)

### Agent Events Not Updating

- Confirm agents are actually running tasks
- Check WebSocket connection: Open DevTools → Network → WS tab
- Try refreshing the page
