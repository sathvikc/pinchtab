# PinchTab Agent Benchmark

Natural language tasks to test how well an agent uses PinchTab from skill docs alone.

## Instructions

1. Read `../../skills/pinchtab/SKILL.md` — this is your only guide
2. For each task, figure out which commands to use
3. **Log every command executed**
4. Record: `./scripts/record-step.sh --type agent <group> <step> <pass|fail> --tokens <in> <out> "notes"`

### Recommended setup: env vars + `./scripts/pt` wrapper

In normal PinchTab deployments the binary is installed on the host and
invoked directly:

```bash
export PINCHTAB_TOKEN=<token>
export PINCHTAB_TAB=$(pinchtab nav http://example.com)
pinchtab snap -i -c
pinchtab click '#submit'
```

The benchmark harness runs PinchTab **inside a Docker container**, so every
invocation normally has to be prefixed with
`docker exec -e PINCHTAB_TOKEN=... -e PINCHTAB_SERVER=... -e PINCHTAB_TAB=... benchmark-pinchtab-1 pinchtab ...`
— ~140 characters of boilerplate per command. The repo ships a tiny wrapper
at `tests/benchmark/scripts/pt` that handles the Docker preamble so you can
use the same terse CLI as a host install:

```bash
# Capture the shared tab ID. pinchtab prints only the tab ID when stdout
# is a pipe, so $(...) capture works directly.
export PINCHTAB_TAB=$(./scripts/pt nav http://fixtures/)

# Every subsequent tab-scoped command auto-targets $PINCHTAB_TAB:
./scripts/pt snap -i -c
./scripts/pt eval "document.title"
./scripts/pt eval --await-promise "window.fetchPayload()"
./scripts/pt click '#submit'
./scripts/pt drag '#piece' --drag-x 12 --drag-y -158

# Record step results:
./scripts/record-step.sh --type agent 1 2 pass "worked"
```

The wrapper is a ~60-line shell script; read `scripts/pt` for the exact
forwarding rules. Flags after `pt` are forwarded verbatim to `pinchtab`, so
anything that works with `pinchtab ...` works with `./scripts/pt ...`.

Explicit `--tab <id>` on any command still wins over `PINCHTAB_TAB`.

## Environment

- PinchTab: `http://localhost:9867`, token: `benchmark-token`
- Fixtures: `http://fixtures/` (running in Docker as `fixtures` hostname)
- Pages: `/`, `/wiki.html`, `/wiki-go.html`, `/articles.html`, `/search.html`,
  `/form.html`, `/dashboard.html`, `/ecommerce.html`, `/spa.html`, `/login.html`

## Group 0: Setup & Diagnosis

### 0.1 Server reachable
Check that the PinchTab server is healthy.

**Verify**: Server responds with `status: ok`.

### 0.2 Auth is required
Make a request to the server WITHOUT an auth token and confirm it is rejected.

**Verify**: Response is HTTP 401 (or other auth-error status).

### 0.3 Auth works with token
Repeat the same request WITH the bearer token and confirm it succeeds.

**Verify**: Response is HTTP 200.

### 0.4 Instance available
Confirm at least one Chrome instance is running. If none exist, start one.

**Verify**: Health response shows `defaultInstance.status == "running"` (or after starting one, the new instance is running).

### 0.5 List existing tabs
Get the current list of open tabs.

**Verify**: A list (possibly empty) is returned without error.

### 0.6 Clean stale tabs
If any tabs from previous runs are open, close them so the benchmark starts from a known state.

**Verify**: After cleanup, the tab list is empty (or only contains a single about:blank tab).

### 0.7 Network reach to target
Navigate to `http://fixtures/` and confirm the fixtures server is reachable from PinchTab.

**Verify**: Navigate returns successfully and the page contains benchmark content.

### 0.8 Capture initial tab ID
Save the tab ID returned by the navigate in 0.7. Use this tab ID for all subsequent tasks to avoid creating new tabs.

**Verify**: A tab ID was captured and matches what `GET /tabs` reports.

## Group 1: Reading & Extracting Real Content

### 1.1 Get the full list of categories from the wiki index
Navigate to `http://fixtures/wiki.html` and extract all category names with their article counts.

**Verify**: Can name at least 2 categories and their article counts (e.g. "Programming Languages: 12 articles").

### 1.2 Navigate by clicking a link
From the wiki index, click the "Go (programming language)" link to navigate to the Go article.

**Verify**: You are now on the Go article page (not the wiki index).

### 1.3 Extract structured data from a table
On the Go article, read the infobox table and answer: Who designed Go, and what year did it first appear?

**Verify**: Answer contains "Robert Griesemer" (or "Rob Pike" or "Ken Thompson") and "2009".

### 1.4 Count list items
On the Go article, count how many key features are listed.

**Verify**: Answer is 6 (verify against `FEATURE_COUNT_6`).

### 1.5 Read all article headlines from articles page
Navigate to `http://fixtures/articles.html` and list all article titles.

**Verify**: Found at least 3 articles including "The Future of Artificial Intelligence".

### 1.6 Read dashboard metrics

**Verify**: Ended up on the Go article page after search.

### 2.2 Search with no results
On `http://fixtures/search.html`, search for something with no results (use "xyznonexistent").

**Verify**: Page handled it gracefully (no crash, some response rendered).

### 2.3 Search for AI content

## Group 4: SPA State Management

### 4.1 Read initial app state
Navigate to `http://fixtures/spa.html?reset=1` (the `?reset=1` query param clears any previous localStorage state so the SPA starts with its default 3 tasks). Read the current task list — how many tasks exist, how many are active vs done?

**Verify**: Found 3 total, 2 active, 1 done (verify `TASK_STATS_TOTAL_3_ACTIVE_2_DONE_1`).

**Verify**: The resolved value contains `ASYNC_PAYLOAD_READY_42`.

### 21.2 Await a promise resolving to an object
On the same page, call `window.fetchUser()` and retrieve the resolved object so you can read a field from it.

**Verify**: The resolved object's `name` field equals `ASYNC_USER_NAME_ADA`.

---

## Group 22: Mouse Drag & Drop

### 22.1 Drag a piece into Zone A
Navigate to `http://fixtures/drag.html`. The page contains a draggable square (`#piece`) and three target zones (`#zone-a`, `#zone-b`, `#zone-c`). Drag the piece so its center ends up over **Zone A**.

**Verify**: The page shows `LAST_DROP=DROP_ZONE_A_OK`.

### 22.2 Drag to Zone B, then Zone C
Without reloading the page, drag the piece next into **Zone B**, and then into **Zone C**. The page records an ordered drop sequence.

**Verify**: The page shows `DROP_SEQUENCE=DROP_ZONE_A_OK,DROP_ZONE_B_OK,DROP_ZONE_C_OK` (all three drops in order).

## Key Differences from Baseline

The agent must:
- Choose between `/text`, `/snapshot`, `/action`, `/navigate` appropriately
- Decide when to use `filter=interactive` vs full snapshot
- Handle multi-step flows without step-by-step curl guidance
- Extract and interpret structured data (tables, lists, counts)
- Detect state changes after interactions
