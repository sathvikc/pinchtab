# PinchTab Agent Benchmark

Natural language tasks to test how well an agent uses PinchTab from skill docs alone.

## Instructions

1. Read `../../skills/pinchtab/SKILL.md` — this is your only guide
2. For each task, figure out which commands to use
3. **Log every command executed**
4. Record: `./scripts/record-step.sh --type agent <group> <step> <pass|fail> --tokens <in> <out> "notes"`

## Environment

- PinchTab: `http://localhost:9867`, token: `benchmark-token`
- Fixtures: `http://fixtures/` (running in Docker as `fixtures` hostname)
- Pages: `/`, `/wiki.html`, `/wiki-go.html`, `/articles.html`, `/search.html`,
  `/form.html`, `/dashboard.html`, `/ecommerce.html`, `/spa.html`, `/login.html`

## Key Differences from Baseline

The agent must:
- Choose between `/text`, `/snapshot`, `/action`, `/navigate` appropriately
- Decide when to use `filter=interactive` vs full snapshot
- Handle multi-step flows without step-by-step curl guidance
- Extract and interpret structured data (tables, lists, counts)
- Detect state changes after interactions
